"# Bulltricker----C" 

-> Introduction

The Bulltricker game is an Alliance of 2 English words: BULL symbolizing power, TRICK meaning
cunning. It is played between two people (no game against the computer).
The inspiration of the basic rules of chess, checkers and go gave him all the originality of his
easy and complete rule, hence endless combinations, traps, twists and turns, stratagems,
reversals of the situation and a fateful or Machiavellian blow make it a real game of strategy.

-> Course and goal of the game:

Each player has 24 game pieces of the same color: 1 king, 8 queens, 15 pawns. Whites
start and each player takes turns playing, one piece per move, pawn, queen, or king.
The object of the game is to trap the opponent's King (as in chess), by locking this King between
four pieces (Pawn and / or Queen) including at least one of your own. This frame called "Mat"
symbolizes the end of the game by meaning that "the King is dead".
