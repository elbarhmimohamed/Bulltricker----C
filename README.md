"# Bulltricker----C" 

-> Introduction

The Bulltricker game is an Alliance of 2 English words: BULL symbolizing power, TRICK meaning
cunning. It is played between two people (no game against the computer).

easy and complete rule, hence endless combinations, traps, twists and turns, stratagems,
reversals of the situation and a fateful or Machiavellian blow make it a real game of strategy.
